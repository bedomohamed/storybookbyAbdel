# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
## Steps to setup the repo
1) git clone https://github.com/bedomohamed/storybookbyAbdel.git
2) run npm install --legacy-peer-deps
PS: we need --legacy-peer-deps flag because of some conflicts in the version of react and babel I was using
3) run npm start to start storybook
4) run npm test to start the test cases
PS: I wrote one test case just to demonstrate that I can write test cases and setup the config correctly
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the storybook.\
Open [http://localhost:6006/](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
